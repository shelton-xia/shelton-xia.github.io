      <p>Hi, I'm Chengxuan (Shelton) Xia. I specialize in developing intelligent systems at the intersection of machine learning, backend engineering, and applied NLP. With experience across AI startups, large-scale foundation models, and real-world deployments, I bring research and product together.</p>

      <p>Previously, I led initiatives at <strong>Adobe</strong> (generative image modeling), <strong>Walmart Labs</strong> (AI workflow engine for smart search), and <strong>Petal.org</strong> (Langchain-based chatbot platform). I'm passionate about designing scalable AI tools and creating intuitive user experiences backed by strong systems thinking.</p>
