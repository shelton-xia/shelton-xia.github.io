    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m <strong>Chengxuan (Shelton) Xia</strong>, an AI Engineer with over 4 years of experience in machine learning, NLP, and AI product development. 
      My work spans from LLM-based applications to full-stack solutions, empowering real-world impact through technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work as a GenAI Engineer at Walmart Global Tech, and I previously led AI product efforts at Petal.org and BearHug AI. 
      I’m also the co-founder of <a href="https://saaisolution.com" target="_blank"><strong>SAAI Solution</strong></a>, a startup focused on providing personalized and privacy-preserving AI solutions for small businesses. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, I’m passionate about the outdoors—I love <strong>camping</strong>, nurturing my <strong>garden</strong>, and observing <strong>wildlife</strong>. These quiet moments help recharge my creative energy.
