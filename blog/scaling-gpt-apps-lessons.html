    <p>Over the past year, we‚Äôve helped multiple teams bring GPT-based applications from proof of concept to production. These projects spanned diverse use cases ‚Äî from internal developer assistants to consumer-facing chatbots and document summarizers for healthcare. While the hype around LLMs fuels rapid experimentation, the path to shipping robust, scalable systems is far less glamorous. In this reflection, I‚Äôll share key lessons from real-world deployments: what broke, what we learned, and what patterns consistently worked.</p>

    <p>One of the most common misconceptions in early-stage LLM development is that a high-quality prompt is enough. Many teams begin with a few successful queries in ChatGPT, wrap that in a web interface, and call it a day. But once exposed to actual users and real-world data, the brittleness emerges. Prompts that worked with clean input fail with noisy text. Responses that seemed insightful are now too verbose or misaligned with user intent. Even worse, performance often fluctuates subtly over time as the model backend updates or as context window strategies degrade.</p>

    <p>Latency also becomes a serious concern. While developers are tolerant of 4‚Äì6 second responses during prototyping, users are not. We saw usage drop 35% when average response times exceeded 5 seconds in one app. Part of the latency came from inefficient tool-chaining ‚Äî calling multiple LLM endpoints sequentially instead of in parallel. But another part came from unnecessary prompt complexity. Simplifying few-shot examples and using function-calling interfaces where possible reduced generation time by up to 40% in some cases.</p>

    <p>Cost management is another area that quickly becomes nontrivial. Many teams underestimate how expensive LLM tokens can get when you scale to thousands of users. In one case, we discovered that a daily cron job for re-indexing summaries was consuming over $600/month ‚Äî solely due to redundant completions of unchanged documents. We introduced caching strategies with hash-based change detection, reducing costs by 80% without sacrificing freshness or relevance.</p>

    <p>In the next section, I‚Äôll share a concrete example of how we redesigned a chatbot pipeline for efficiency and stability ‚Äî including some code to illustrate these ideas.</p>

    <p>We were working with a legal tech company that built a case summarization assistant for lawyers. The original implementation used a sequential chain of summarization + Q&A + citation validation using GPT-4. Each component called the API with full documents passed inline. We replaced this pipeline with a more memory-efficient and parallelized structure. Below is a simplified structure that highlights the improvements:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Efficient prompt function with caching
    function summarizeCase(docId, content) {
      const cacheKey = hash(content);
      const cached = checkCache(docId, cacheKey);
      if (cached) return cached;
    
      const prompt = `Summarize the following legal case:\n\n${content}`;
      const summary = callLLM(prompt);
      storeCache(docId, cacheKey, summary);
      return summary;
    }
    
    // Run Q&A and citation checker in parallel
    async function analyzeCase(summary, questions) {
      const qaTask = callLLM({ task: "qa", input: summary, questions });
      const citationTask = callLLM({ task: "citation_check", input: summary });
      return await Promise.all([qaTask, citationTask]);
    }
    
    // Pipeline coordinator
    async function processCase(docId, content, questions) {
      const summary = summarizeCase(docId, content);
      const [qaResult, citationResult] = await analyzeCase(summary, questions);
      return {
        summary,
        qa: qaResult,
        citations: citationResult
      };
    }</code></pre>

    <p>This structure gave us three wins: reduced latency (~50%), lower token cost (due to deduplication), and better auditability (since each step was traceable and cacheable). Most importantly, it allowed us to iterate each module independently with clear regression testing.</p>

    <p>Scaling GPT-based apps is no longer a novelty challenge ‚Äî it's an engineering discipline. Prompting matters, yes. But just as important are the supporting systems: caching, monitoring, testing, fallback logic, and user analytics. The organizations that take this seriously will be the ones that unlock real long-term value from LLMs.</p>
