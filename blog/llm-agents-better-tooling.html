  <h1>Why LLM Agents Need Better Tooling</h1>
  <p><em>August 20, 2024 · LLM, AI Agents</em></p>

  <p>In this blog, I talk about the limitations of current LLM-based agent frameworks, especially around scalability, testing, and integration with real-world systems. Agents need better error handling, runtime monitoring, and planning capabilities.</p>

  <p>Tooling should focus on making agents composable and inspectable — not just prompt-stuffed chatbots. I also share my experience using LangChain and how it could evolve to support more robust flows.</p>
